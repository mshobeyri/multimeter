# MMT Overview

A quick tour of Multimeter `.mmt` YAML types: api, test, and envâ€”what each is for, how they relate, and where to go deeper.

For full details, see the references:
- [API](./api-mmt.md)
- [Test](./test-mmt.md)
- [Environment](./environment-mmt.md)

## API (type: api)
Purpose: Define a single HTTP/WS request with inputs, headers, body, and extraction rules.

Minimal example
```yaml
type: api
protocol: http
url: https://abc.com/login
method: post
format: json
headers: 
 - content-type: application/json
body:
  username: mehrdad
  password: 123456
# Capture values from the response
extract:
  token: body[token]
```
Use from Tests: tests import APIs and call them with inputs.

Deep dive: see [API](./api-mmt.md).

## Test (type: test)
Purpose: Orchestrate flows using steps/stages; call APIs/tests, assert, loop, and set outputs.

Minimal example for calling loging and make sure the response is fine.
```yaml
type: test
title: Login flow
import:
  login: ./api/login.mmt
inputs:
  user: string
  pass: string
steps:
  - call: login
    id: doLogin
    inputs: 
      user: i:user
      pass: i:pass
  - assert: doLogin.status == 200
  - set:
    token: doLogin.token
```
UI: The flow is editable/visible in the Flow and Test panels; logs appear in Log.
Run: Click Run in the Test panel or use CLI (testlight run ...).

Deep dive: see [Test](./test-mmt.md).

## Environment (type: env)
Purpose: Centralize variables and presets.

Minimal example
```yaml
type: env
variables:
  API_URL:
    dev: http://localhost:8080
    prod: https://api.example.com
  test_type: 
    - smoke
    - regression
presets:
  runner:
    dev: 
      API_URL: dev
      test_type: smoke
    ci:  
      API_URL: prod
      test_type: regression
```
Here we defined two urls 'dev' and 'prod' to switch target machines easily. Also a variable called test type to filter some of tests for example. In the presets section also we defined two presets as environmets that can modify both variables with just one click.
variables are accessible in the whole yamls by ```e:NAME``` and ```<<e:NAME>>```.

Deep dive: see [Environment](./environment-mmt.md).

## How they fit together
- Tests import APIs and data; Environments supply variables consumed by both.
- Inputs (<<i:key>>) are test-provided; Envs (e:VAR) come from env files/UI.
- The JS that runs is generated automatically from your YAML.
